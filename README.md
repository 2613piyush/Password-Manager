# Password Manager
A *Password Manager Web Application* built using *Java (Spring Boot)* with a simple *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend*.
This project securely stores and manages user passwords using *AES encryption* and an *H2 in-memory database*.

## Project Overview
This Password Manager project is developed as part of the *Fundamentals of DevOps (INT331)* course.
It allows users to store and manage passwords securely. The backend is powered by *Spring Boot*, and *Maven* is used for dependency management.
Currently, the application uses an *H2 in-memory database*, which means the data exists only while the application is running. The project can be easily extended to use a permanent database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

## Features
* Add and manage passwords
* Secure password storage using *AES encryption*
* Backend built with *Spring Boot (Java)*
* Simple and responsive frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* Maven-based project structure
* H2 in-memory database
* Easy to extend and customize

## Folder Explanation
* **src/main/java** – Backend source code (controllers, services, models, configs)
* **src/main/resources** – Application configuration files
* **pom.xml** – Maven dependencies and build configuration
* **target/** – Compiled output generated by Maven

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
* Java JDK (8 or above)
* Maven
* Any IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code / Eclipse – optional)

## Installation & Run

1. **Clone the repository**
git clone https://github.com/2613piyush/Password-Manager.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
cd Password-Manager

3. **Build the project**
mvn clean package

4. **Run the application**
mvn spring-boot:run

5. **Open in browser**
http://localhost:8080

## 🔍 How It Works
* User enters password details via frontend
* Backend encrypts the password using AES encryption
* Encrypted data is stored in the H2 database
* Passwords are decrypted only when required

**Note:** Since H2 is an in-memory database, all data will be lost when the application stops.
