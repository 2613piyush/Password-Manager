# 🔐 Password Manager

A **Password Manager Web Application** built using **Java (Spring Boot)** with a simple **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend**.
This project securely stores and manages user passwords using **AES encryption** and an **H2 in-memory database**.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This Password Manager project is developed as part of the **Fundamentals of DevOps (INT331)** course.
It allows users to store and manage passwords securely. The backend is powered by **Spring Boot**, and **Maven** is used for dependency management.

Currently, the application uses an **H2 in-memory database**, which means the data exists only while the application is running. The project can be easily extended to use a permanent database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

## 🚀 Features

* Add and manage passwords
* Secure password storage using **AES encryption**
* Backend built with **Spring Boot (Java)**
* Simple and responsive frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* Maven-based project structure
* H2 in-memory database
* Easy to extend and customize

### Folder Explanation

* **src/main/java** – Backend source code (controllers, services, models, configs)
* **src/main/resources** – Application configuration files
* **pom.xml** – Maven dependencies and build configuration
* **target/** – Compiled output generated by Maven

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Java JDK (8 or above)
* Maven
* Any IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code / Eclipse – optional)

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Run

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2613piyush/Password-Manager.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

```bash
cd Password-Manager
```

3. **Build the project**

```bash
mvn clean package
```

4. **Run the application**

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

5. **Open in browser**

```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## 🔍 How It Works

* User enters password details via frontend
* Backend encrypts the password using AES encryption
* Encrypted data is stored in the H2 database
* Passwords are decrypted only when required

⚠️ **Note:** Since H2 is an in-memory database, all data will be lost when the application stops.
